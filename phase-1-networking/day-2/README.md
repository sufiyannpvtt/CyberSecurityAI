# Phase 1 – Networking (Day 2)

## Objective

To understand OSI layers by capturing real network packets using Wireshark.

## What I Did

- Captured DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic
- Applied filters to analyze different protocols
- Mapped packets to OSI layers

## Key Learning

- DNS resolves domains to IPs
- HTTP traffic is readable
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted using TLS

## Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Ubuntu Linux
